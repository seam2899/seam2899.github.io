			Where I'm From
		</title>

		<p>
			Before moving to Maine to attend the University of Maine, I am originally from the great state of New Jersey. I grew up in a town called Kearny, and attended a jesuit highschool in the bordering city. In Jersey City, the city my high school was located in, I attended Saint Peter's Prepatory School. While there I was part of the campus ministry team, a leadership group at the school, and was also apart of a few sports teams.

			Also, outside of school I helped with the rec leagues for my town. I coached a few child soccer teams, and tried to help them have the most fun they could!
