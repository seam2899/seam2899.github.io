			As a second semester freshman here at the University of Maine, I decided to rush a fraternity. After finding the one I liked most, Theta Chi, I eventually became a brother. From there I went on two become president, which has helped me with my management skills. It has sent me to multiple leadership conferences throughout the country and continues to help me with my quick thinking.
